# Hurricane-Research
These are the various files I used to conduct research as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at Pace University under Dr. Parisi in 2023. All of the data was in excel files, therefore any computations were read from the excel sheet and written back into it if necessary

## Averages
Some of the data was recorded monthly and other data was recorded yearly so this file computed the average annual data if it was originally in a monthly format. This is also the file that I used to create the large excel sheet with all of the data on it.

## Poisson
The code starts by asking which independent variable we want to use for the regression, annual tropical storm counts and annual hurricaine counts were the best independent variables to choose from. Then the poisson regression must be trained on a training data set before using it on the test data set. Then it is used on the test data set and predicted values are produced and compared to the actual values before computing the line of best fit.

## Descriptive Statistics
I essentially used this file to produce any needed graphs. The program will compute the necessary descriptive statistics like correlation coefficient both Spearman and Pearson p-values were used, if the calculations produce any statistical significant results then a graph will be produced.
